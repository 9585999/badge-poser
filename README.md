## How to create your own Badge
-  Go to the [Badge Poser](https://poser.pugx.org) website
-  Insert username/repository and click on `Show`
-  That's it!  Copy the Markdown into the README.md

## Why a composer badge?

Not only because all the other languages already had it, but having the latest stable release in the readme could save time.
